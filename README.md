This repository contains a single file, `Basic.rb`, with beginner-friendly Ruby examples demonstrating:

- Printing and string interpolation
- Variables
- Arrays and iteration
- Hashes
- Methods and default args
- A simple class
- File I/O
- Blocks and Enumerable
- Exception handling
- Command-line arguments

Run:
